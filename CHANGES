Changes from 1.51-jody5 to 1.51-jody6 [JLB]

- Increased "chunk size" for better performance and to solve the disk
  thrashing problem when checking two large files for a match
- When using the -H option, hard links now automatically match each
  other without performing any file reads
- Changed primary memory allocator to string_alloc by Jody Bruchon
  to improve performance over generic malloc/calloc
- Progress indicator now lists the number of duplicate pairs found in
  addition to the usual file progress count and completion percentage
- Progress is updated more rapidly when full file comparisons happen
  so users are less likely to think fdupes is "frozen"
- Floating point code was made optional and is removed by default
- A comparison script was added to check built fdupes behavior against
  whatever fdupes is currently installed on the system
- Added "undocumented" -Q / --quick option which is not fully safe but can
  be used to drastically reduce run time for large data sets if some risk
  of data loss is acceptable to the user
- Added -O/--paramorder option to sort files by the order their parent
  directory set was specified on the command line first. This makes it
  possible to choose what directories' files get preserved over others
  while using -d and -N together
- The file list loading progress indicator was revamped. Rather than a
  simple "spinning pipe" indicator, it now shows the number of files and
  directories scanned as well as which command line specified set the
  scanning is currently happening in
- fdupes was enhanced to support more than 2 million files total by
  changing from 'int' internal sizes to the maximum supported by the
  platform being compiled for
- Hard link code was modified to be much safer; now any file is only
  permanently deleted after a hard link succeeds

Changes from 1.51-jody4-jkl1 to 1.51-jody5 [JLB]

- Less malloc()s so less memory usage and a slight speedup
- Change --order=name to an intelligent numerically correct sort
- Fixed bug where progress text was missing until first update
- Performance boost for small files (4KB or less) by not running
  redundant hashes and comparisons
- Test files added for numerically correct sort ordering

Changes from 1.51-jody4 to 1.51-jody4-jkl1 [JKL]

- added `--xsize=SIZE' option: exclude files of size < SIZE
- updated Makefile: `PREFIX = /usr/local'
- updated README: Usage to reflect curent parameters

Changes from 1.51-jody2 to 1.51-jody4 [JLB]

- Add support for hard linking duplicates with -L switch
- Updated jody_hash algorithm with much lower collision rate
- Remove freopen() call that posed a portability problem
- Improved progress indicator behavior
- Many minor bug fixes

Changes from 1.51 to 1.51-jody2 [JLB]

- Switched to C99
- Replaced MD5 with Jody Bruchon's hash function
- Added a delay to progress indications for better performance
- Removed lots of unused code
- Ported fdupes to Microsoft Windows (with MinGW)

Changes from 1.50 to 1.51

- Added support for 64-bit file offsets on 32-bit systems.
- Using tty for interactive input instead of regular stdin. This is to
  allow  feeding filenames via stdin in future versions of fdupes without
  breaking interactive deletion feature.
- Fixed some typos in --help.
- Turned C++ style comments into C style comments.

Changes from 1.40 to 1.50-PR2

- Fixed memory leak. [JB]
- Added "--summarize" option. [AL]
- Added "--recurse:" selective recursion option. [AL]
- Added "--noprompt" option for totally automated deletion of
  duplicate files.
- Now sorts duplicates (old to new) for consistent order when
  listing or deleteing duplicate files.
- Now tests for early matching of files, which should help speed up
  the matching process when large files are involved.
- Added warning whenever a file cannot be deleted. [CHL, AL]
- Fixed bug where some files would not be closed after failure. [AL]
- Fixed bug where confirmmatch() function wouldn't always deal
  properly with zero-length files. [AL]
- Fixed bug where progress indicator would not be cleared
  when no files were found. [AL]
- Removed experimental red-black tree code (it was slower on
  my system than the default code). [AL]
- Modified md5/md5.c to avoid compiler warning. [CHL]
- Changes to fdupes.c for compilation under platforms where
  getopt_long is unavailable. [LR, AL]
- Changes to help text for clarity. [AL]
- Various changes and improvements to Makefile. [PB, AL]

Changes from 1.31 to 1.40

- Added option to omit the first file in each group
  of matches. [LM, AL]
- Added escaping of filenames containing spaces when
  sameline option is specified. [AL]
- Changed version indicator format from "fdupes version X.Y"
  to the simpler "fdupes X.Y". [AL]
- Changed ordering of options appearing in the help
  text (--help), manpage, and README file. [AL]

Changes from 1.30 to 1.31

- Added interactive option to preserve all files during
  delete procedure (something similar was already in
  place, but now it's official). [AL]
- Updated delete procedure prompt format. [AL]
- Cosmetic code changes. [AL]

Changes from 1.20 to 1.30

- Added size option to display size of duplicates. [LB, AL]
- Added missing typecast for proper compilation under g++. [LB]
- Better handling of errors occurring during retrieval
  of a file's signature. [KK, AL]
- No longer displays an error message when specified
  directories contain no files. [AL]
- Added red-black tree structure (experimental compile-time
  option, disabled by default). [AL]

Changes from 1.12 to 1.20

- Fixed bug where program would crash when files being
  scanned were named pipes or sockets. [FD]
- Fix against security risk resulting from the use of a
  temporary file to store md5sum output. [FD, AL]
- Using an external md5sum program is now optional. Started
  using L. Peter Deutsh's MD5 library instead. [FD, AL]
- Added hardlinks option to distinguish between hard links
  and actual duplicate files. [FD, AL]
- Added noempty option to exclude zero-length files
  from consideration [AL]

Changes from 1.11 to 1.12

- Improved handling of extremely long input on preserve
  prompt (delete option). [SSD, AL]

Changes from 1.1 to 1.11

- Started checking file sizes before signatures
  for better performance.  [AB, AL]
- Added fdupes manpage. [AB, AL]

Changes from 1.0 to 1.1

- Added delete option for semi-automatic deletion
  of duplicate files. [AL]
