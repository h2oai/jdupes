Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
FDUPES is a program for identifying duplicate files residing
within specified directories. This fork known as 'fdupes-jody' is
heavily modified from and improved over the original. See CHANGES
for details.


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: fdupes [options] DIRECTORY...

 -r --recurse          for every directory given follow subdirectories
                       encountered within
 -R --recurse:         for each directory given after this option follow
                       subdirectories encountered within (note the ':' at
                       the end of the option, manpage for more details)
 -s --symlinks         follow symlinks
 -H --hardlinks        normally, when two or more files point to the same
                       disk area they are treated as non-duplicates; this
                       option will change this behavior
 -L --linkhard         hardlink duplicate files to the first file in
                       each set of duplicates without prompting the user
 -n --noempty          exclude zero-length files from consideration
 -x --xsize=SIZE       exclude files of size < SIZE from consideration; the
                       SIZE argument accepts 'k', 'M' and 'G' unit suffix
 -A --nohidden         exclude hidden files from consideration
 -f --omitfirst        omit the first file in each set of matches
 -1 --sameline         list each set of matches on a single line
 -S --size             show size of duplicate files
 -m --summarize        summarize dupe information
 -q --quiet            hide progress indicator
 -d --delete           prompt user for files to preserve and delete all
                       others; important: under particular circumstances,
                       data may be lost when using this option together
                       with -s or --symlinks, or when specifying a
                       particular directory more than once; refer to the
                       fdupes documentation for additional information
 -N --noprompt         together with --delete, preserve the first file in
                       each set of duplicates and delete the rest without
                       prompting the user
 -p --permissions      don't consider files with different owner/group or
                       permission bits as duplicates
 -o --order=BY         select sort order for output, linking and deleting; by
                       mtime (BY='time'; default) or filename (BY='name')
 -O --paramorder        Parameter order is more important than selected -O sort
 -v --version          display fdupes version
 -h --help             display this help message

Unless -1 or --sameline is specified, duplicate files are listed
together in groups, each file displayed on a separate line. The
groups are then separated from each other by blank lines.

When -1 or --sameline is specified, spaces and backslash characters (\)
appearing in a filename are preceded by a backslash character. For
instance, "with spaces" becomes "with\ spaces".

When using -d or --delete, care should be taken to insure against
accidental data loss. While no information will be immediately
lost, using this option together with -s or --symlink can lead
to confusing information being presented to the user when prompted
for files to preserve. Specifically, a user could accidentally
preserve a symlink while deleting the file it points to. A similar
problem arises when specifying a particular directory more than
once. All files within that directory will be listed as their own
duplicates, leading to data loss should a user preserve a file
without its "duplicate" (the file itself!).
