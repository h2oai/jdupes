Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
jdupes is a program for identifying and taking actions upon duplicate
files. This fork known as 'jdupes' is heavily modified from and improved
over the original. See CHANGES for details.

A WORD OF WARNING: jdupes IS NOT a drop-in compatible replacement for
fdupes! Do not blindly replace fdupes with jdupes in scripts and expect
everything to work the same way. Option availability and meanings differ
between the two programs. For example, the -I switch in jdupes means
"isolate" and blocks intra-argument matching, while in fdupes it means
"immediately delete files during scanning without prompting the user."


Why use jdupes instead of the original fdupes or other forks?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest reason is raw speed. In testing on various data sets, jdupes is
over 7 times faster than fdupes-1.51 on average.

jdupes is the only Windows port of fdupes. Most duplicate scanners built on
Linux and other UNIX-like systems do not compile for Windows out-of-the-box
and even if they do, they don't support Unicode and other Windows-specific
quirks and features.

jdupes is generally stable. All releases of jdupes are compared against a
known working reference version of fdupes or jdupes to be certain that
output does not change. You get the benefits of an aggressive development
process without putting your data at increased risk.

Code in jdupes is written with data loss avoidance as the highest priority.
If a choice must be made between being aggressive or careful, the careful
way is always chosen.

jdupes includes features that are not found in fdupes. Examples of
such features include btrfs block-level deduplication and control over
which file is kept when a match set is automatically deleted. jdupes is
not afraid of dropping features of low value; a prime example is the -1
switch which outputs all matches in a set on one line, a feature which was
found to be useless in real-world tests and therefore thrown out.

The downside is that jdupes development is never guaranteed to be bug-free!
If the program eats your dog or sets fire to your lawn, the authors cannot
be held responsible. If you notice a bug, please report it.

While jdupes maintains some degree of compatibility with fdupes from which
it was originally derived, there is no guarantee that it will continue to
maintain such compatibility in the future.


What jdupes is not: a similar (but not identical) file finding tool
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please note that jdupes ONLY works on 100% exact matches. It does not have
any sort of "similarity" matching, nor does it know anything about any
specific file formats such as images or sounds. Something as simple as a
change in embedded metadata such as the ID3 tags in an MP3 file or the EXIF
information in a JPEG image will not change the sound or image presented to
the user when opened, but technically it makes the file no longer identical
to the original.

Plenty of excellent tools already exist to "fuzzy match" specific file types
using knowledge of their file formats to help. There are no plans to add
this type of matching to jdupes.


Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage: jdupes [options] DIRECTORY...

 -A --nohidden    	exclude hidden files from consideration
 -B --dedupe      	Send matches to btrfs for block-level deduplication
 -d --delete      	prompt user for files to preserve and delete all
                  	others; important: under particular circumstances,
                  	data may be lost when using this option together
                  	with -s or --symlinks, or when specifying a
                  	particular directory more than once; refer to the
                  	documentation for additional information
 -f --omitfirst   	omit the first file in each set of matches
 -h --help        	display this help message
 -H --hardlinks   	treat hard-linked files as duplicate files. Normally
                  	hard links are treated as non-duplicates for safety
 -i --reverse     	reverse (invert) the match sort order
 -I --isolate     	files in the same specified directory won't match
 -L --linkhard    	hard link all duplicate files without prompting
                  	Windows allows a maximum of 1023 hard links per file
 -m --summarize   	summarize dupe information
 -n --noempty     	exclude zero-length files from consideration
 -N --noprompt    	together with --delete, preserve the first file in
                  	each set of duplicates and delete the rest without
                  	prompting the user
 -o --order=BY    	select sort order for output, linking and deleting; by
 -O --paramorder  	Parameter order is more important than selected -O sort
                  	mtime (BY=time) or filename (BY=name, the default)
 -p --permissions 	don't consider files with different owner/group or
                  	permission bits as duplicates
 -r --recurse     	for every directory given follow subdirectories
                  	encountered within
 -R --recurse:    	for each directory given after this option follow
                  	subdirectories encountered within (note the ':' at
                  	the end of the option, manpage for more details)
 -s --symlinks    	follow symlinks
 -S --size        	show size of duplicate files
 -q --quiet       	hide progress indicator
 -v --version     	display jdupes version and license information
 -x --xsize=SIZE  	exclude files of size < SIZE bytes from consideration
    --xsize=+SIZE 	'+' specified before SIZE, exclude size > SIZE
                  	K/M/G size suffixes can be used (case-insensitive)
 -Z --softabort   	If the user aborts (i.e. CTRL-C) act on matches so far
Duplicate files are listed together in groups with each file displayed on a
Separate line. The groups are then separated from each other by blank lines.

The -s/--symlinks option will treat symlinked files as regular files and
follow symlinked directories, but direct symlinks will be treated as if
they are hard linked files and the -H/--hardlinks option will apply to
them in the same manner.

When using -d or --delete, care should be taken to insure against accidental
data loss. While no information will be immediately lost, using this option
together with -s or --symlink can lead to confusing information being
presented to the user when prompted for files to preserve. Specifically, a
user could accidentally preserve a symlink while deleting the file it points
to. A similar problem arises when specifying a particular directory more
than once. All files within that directory will be listed as their own
duplicates, leading to data loss should a user preserve a file without its
"duplicate" (the file itself!)

The -I/--isolate option attempts to block matches that are contained in
the same specified directory parameter on the command line. Due to the
underlying nature of the jdupes algorithm, a lot of matches will be
blocked by this option that probably should not be. This code could use
improvement.


Hard linking status symbols and behavior
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A set of arrows are used in hard linking to show what action was taken on
each link candidate. These arrows are as follows:

----> File was hard linked to the first file in the duplicate chain

-==-> Already a hard link to the first file in the chain

-//-> Hard linking failed due to an error during the linking process

If your data set has hard linked files and you do not use -L to always
consider them as duplicates, you may still see hard linked files appear
together in match sets. This is caused by a separate file that matches
the hard linked files and is the correct behavior.

Microsoft Windows platform-specific notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Windows port does not support Unicode, only ANSI file names. This is
because Unicode support on Windows is difficult to add to existing code
without making it very messy or breaking things. Support is eventually
planned for Unicode on Windows.

Windows has a hard limit of 1024 hard links per file. There is no way to
change this. The documentation for CreateHardLink() states: "The maximum
number of hard links that can be created with this function is 1023 per
file. If more than 1023 links are created for a file, an error results."
(The number is actually 1024, but they're ignoring the first file.)
